# Discount Calculator

This is a basic Python script that calculates the final price of an item based on the original price and a discount percentage.

## Features
- Accepts user input for original price and discount percentage
- Applies discount only if it's 20% or more
- Returns the final price after applying the discount

## Usage

1. Run the script in a Python environment:
   bash
   python discount_calculator.py
   
2. Input the original price and the discount percentage when prompted.

3. The script will display the final price.

## Example

Enter the original price: 1000  
Enter the discount percentage: 25  
Final price: 750.0

## Notes
